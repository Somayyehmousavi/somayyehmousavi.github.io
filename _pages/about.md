This is my pleasure that you are visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science and Informatics (CSI) program at Emory University, specializing in biomedical informatics under the supervision of Dr. [Reza Sameni](https://sameni.info).
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, physiological signal analysis, and electronic health record data. I focus on learning from large-scale, longitudinal datasets to develop demography-aware AI and machine learning models that support more personalized and equitable healthcare solutions.

I hold two master's degrees: one in Computer Science and Informatics from Emory University, and another in Biomedical Engineering (Bioelectric) from the University of Zanjan. I also earned a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked for over two years as a biomedical engineer in a hospital setting, gaining hands-on clinical experience that has deepened my understanding of the practical challenges in healthcare technology development. I aim to make meaningful contributions to the fields of biomedical informatics and healthcare AI. Research Interset
